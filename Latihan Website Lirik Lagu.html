                When tomorrow comes<br>
                I'll be on my own<br>
                Feeling frightened of<br>
                The things that I don't know<br>
                When tomorrow comes<br>
                Tomorrow comes<br>
                Tomorrow comes<br>
                And though the road is long<br>
                I look up to the sky<br>
                And in the dark I found,<br>
                I lost hope that I won't fly<br>
                And I sing along, I sing along<br>
                And I sing along<br>
                I got all I need when I got you and I<br>
                I look around me, and see a sweet life<br>
                I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight<br>
                You're getting me, getting me through the night<br>
                Kick start my heart when you shine it in my eyes<br>
                Can't lie, it's a sweet life<br>
                I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight<br>
                You're getting me, getting me through the night<br>
                'Cause you're my flashlight (flashlight)<br>
                You're my flashlight (flashlight)<br>
                You're my flashlight<br>
                I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top<br>
                I'm not afraid when the rain won't stop<br>
                'Cause you light the way<br>
                You light the way, you light the way<br>
                I got all I need when I got you and I<br>
                I look around me, and see a sweet life<br>
                I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight<br>
                You're getting me, getting me through the night<br>
                Kick start my heart when you shine it in my eyes<br>

                I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight<br>
                You're getting me, getting me through the night<br>
